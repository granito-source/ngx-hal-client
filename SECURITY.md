# Security Policy

Granito takes the security of our code seriously. If you believe you have found
a security vulnerability in the _Angular HAL Client_, please **DO NOT** disclose
it publicly until we’ve had a chance to fix it. Please don’t report security
vulnerabilities using GitHub issues, instead follow the instructions below
to disclose it responsibly.

## Supported Versions

_Angular HAL Client_ has not been released yet. We publish developers' previews,
which allow up to refine the API of the library in a real-world Angular project.
As such, only the latest published developers' preview shold be considered when
reporting security issues.

Going forward, after the first release is published, the latest two major releases
will be supported for security updates as well as the upcoming major release
(code in _main_ branch).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In order to report a vulnerability, please navigate to the
[Security](https://github.com/granito-source/ngx-hal-client/security) of this
repository and use _Report vulnerability_ button to disclose your findings
privately.
